# TopTrumps

Apologies in advance for a slightly inarticulate description. I've injured my right hand and am dictating this!

Using whatever technology you feel most comfortable with, please model the gameplay of Top Trumps.

Please start by modelling an individual card and work towards playing a game from start to finish. 

At this stage, I am most interested in understanding your ability to reason around this data/logic problem. Good looking UI is less important.

It is not expected that you will finish this challenge. Please spend no longer than one hour on this challenge.
